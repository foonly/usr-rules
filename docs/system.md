# The System

## Dice Rolls

Skill and Attribute checks are rolled with a varying amount of D10 dice, and if one of the dice is equal or lower than
the target number, the roll is a success.

### Roll Difficulty
When performing skill rolls the GM assigns a difficulty to the roll according to how hard the action would be to perform in the game. The final difficulty is always up to the GM, but the table below should give some guidelines. This difficulty dictates how many dice are to be rolled for that action.

| Difficulty     | # Dice | Example                                          |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Routine        | 6      | Climbing a ladder.                               |
| Easy           | 5      | Climbing a rope ladder.                          |
| Normal         | 4      | Climbing a knotted rope.                         |
| Tricky         | 3      | Climbing a normal rope.                          |
| Hard           | 2      | Climbing a rough stone wall.                     |
| Very Hard      | 1      | Climbing a brick wall.                           |
| Extremely Hard | 2*     | Climbing an overhang.                            |
| Special        | 3*     | These levels are only used with extra modifiers. |
| Special        | 4*     |                                                  |

The dice with * at the bottom of the table means that all dice must roll under the target number of the roll. This is a way for extra modifiers, like wound modifiers, to affect rolls further down than 1. The GM might call for these difficulties in some circumstances
