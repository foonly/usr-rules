# The System

## Dice Rolls

Skill and Attribute checks are rolled with a varying amount of D10 dice, and if one of the dice is
equal or lower than
the target number, the roll is a success.

### Roll Difficulty

When performing skill rolls the GM assigns a difficulty to the roll according to how hard the action
would be to perform in the game. The final difficulty is always up to the GM, but the table below
should give some guidelines. This difficulty dictates how many dice are to be rolled for that
action.

| Difficulty     | # Dice | Example                                          |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Routine        | 6      | Climbing a ladder.                               |
| Easy           | 5      | Climbing a rope ladder.                          |
| Normal         | 4      | Climbing a knotted rope.                         |
| Tricky         | 3      | Climbing a normal rope.                          |
| Hard           | 2      | Climbing a rough stone wall.                     |
| Very Hard      | 1      | Climbing a brick wall.                           |
| Extremely Hard | 2*     | Climbing an overhang.                            |
| Special        | 3*     | These levels are only used with extra modifiers. |
| Special        | 4*     |                                                  |

The dice with * at the bottom of the table means that all dice must roll under the target number of
the roll. This is a way for extra modifiers, like wound modifiers to reduce rolls further down
than 1 die. The GM might call for these difficulties in special circumstances.

## Attributes

Attribute values range from 0 to 7, but in practice only values from 1 to 6 are used. Attributes
are world dependent, but there will be an example list that should be a good default.

Attributes give a bonus to skills, and can also be used as a direct roll against the value. The
skill bonus is half the value rounded down, as shown in this table.

| Value | Bonus |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 0     |
| 2     | 1     |
| 3     | 1     |
| 4     | 2     | 
| 5     | 2     |
| 6     | 3     |
| 7     | 3     |

### Example Attribute List

#### Fortitude

The strength and stamina of the character.

#### Quickness

The speed and agility of the character.

#### Dexterity

The fine motor skills of the character.

#### Perception

The ability of the character to notice things.

#### Willpower

The strength of will and determinism of the character.

#### Charisma

The charm and presence of the character.

#### Intelligence

The smarts and knowledge of the character.

## Skills
Skills are used as the base value you roll against when your character is performing an action 
corresponding to that skill. Skills are always modified by an attribute bonus.  

Skill values range from 0 to 4. A value of 0 means the character don't know the skill, it may 
still be rolled against the pure attribute bonus if the GM allows.

Skill, even more so than attributes are world dependent, but here are some example for different 
settings. The groups are purely organisational, and have no function in the system. The value in 
parentheses is the default attribute bonus to use.
