# The System

## Dice Rolls

Skill and Attribute checks are rolled with a varying amount of D10 dice, and if one of the dice is
equal or lower than
the target number, the roll is a success.

### Roll Difficulty

When performing skill rolls the GM assigns a difficulty to the roll according to how hard the action
would be to perform in the game. The final difficulty is always up to the GM, but the table below
should give some guidelines. This difficulty dictates how many dice are to be rolled for that
action.

| Difficulty     | # Dice | Example                                          |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Routine        | 6      | Climbing a ladder.                               |
| Easy           | 5      | Climbing a rope ladder.                          |
| Normal         | 4      | Climbing a knotted rope.                         |
| Tricky         | 3      | Climbing a normal rope.                          |
| Hard           | 2      | Climbing a rough stone wall.                     |
| Very Hard      | 1      | Climbing a brick wall.                           |
| Extremely Hard | 2*     | Climbing an overhang.                            |
| Special        | 3*     | These levels are only used with extra modifiers. |
| Special        | 4*     |                                                  |

The dice with * at the bottom of the table means that all dice must roll under the target number of
the roll. This is a way for extra modifiers, like wound modifiers, to affect rolls further down than
1. The GM might call for these difficulties in some circumstances.

## Attributes

Attribute values range from 0 to 7, but in practice only values from 1 to 6 are used. Attributes
are world dependent, but there will be an example list that should be a good default.

Attributes give a bonus to skills, and can also be used as a direct roll against the value. The
skill bonus is half the value rounded down, as shown in this table.

| Value | Bonus |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | 0     |
| 1     | 0     |
| 2     | 1     |
| 3     | 1     |
| 4     | 2     | 
| 5     | 2     |
| 6     | 3     |
| 7     | 3     |
